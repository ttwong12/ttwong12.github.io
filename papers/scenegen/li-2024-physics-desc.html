   <i><b>Physics-based Scene Layout Generation from Human Motion (SIGGRAPH 2024)</b></i></font><br> 
  As character motion is often captured in a blue-screened studio without real furniture or objects in place,,
  there may be a discrepancy between the planned motion and the captured one. Hence, the scene/furniture may have to be adjusted accordingly.
  Given a character motion, our method selects the approprate furnitures
  from a library to fit the motion in a physically plausible fashion. The scene layout is simultaneously optimized 
  with the physics based motion simulation to determine the optimal scene layout.
